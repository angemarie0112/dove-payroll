Dove payroll is an electronic system that manages a company’s payroll. 

This it does by gathering employee information – which includes: basic information, next-of-kens, Benefits, and Salary Profiles – to calculate their taxes and net payable salaries.
All the calculations for each of the employees are compiled on a paycheque which would be used by the system to generate the payroll for that period.

The proposed system manages the payroll for many companies in any of the configured tax regions.
A tax region is any geographical region that has it's basic information and tax definitions in the system’s data source.
During tax calculations, the system would pull tax definitions of the tax region to which the company is registered.

Moreover, companies can use this system to efficiently manage employee records and salary disbursements.
Employees can manage their basic information (on approval of the HR), make salary change requests to the company HR and view their paycheques. 

The HR can register and manage employee basic information, add and manage employee’s salary profiles and approve paycheques.

The CEO can perform any action at the company level. 

The site manager can perform the functions of the HR related to employee basic information.

The Finance officer is responsible for tax and salary calculations which creates the paycheques and hence the company payroll for the specified period.

Furthermore, the system can generate reports on different system entities including employee information, paycheques, salary profiles and payrolls which are accessible to
employees of with the appropriate access rights at the company level.
